# Intro
- A probability space is a triple (Ω, F, P) 
- Sample spaces may be *discrete* or *continuous*

## Sigma algebra
- Ω := {heads,tails} and F := {heads or tails, heads,tails, ∅} 
- If a set S ∈ F then S' ∈ F.
- if S1, S2,...,Sn ∈ F then S1 U S2 ... Sn ∈ F.
- Ω ∈ F
- F is the sigma algebra
- P (Ω) = 1

# Probabilty Measure
A probability measure is a function defined over the sets in a σ-algebra F such that:
**Axiom 1:** P(S)>=0 for any event S ∈ F
**Axiom 2:** Prob. of the union of all the possible events,S in F = the sum of the probability of each event - For disjoint sets
**Axiom 3:**  P (Ω) = 1 

## Note
- A ⊆ B implies P (A) ≤ P (B)
